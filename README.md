# Objective:

Extracted data from one or more database tables using basic SQL query techniques.

# Deliverables:

A SQL script that includes the following:
	

1.	Data Selection
	
•Usage of SELECT * to retrieve all columns.
  
•Usage of SELECT column1, column2 to retrieve specific columns.

	

2.	Filtering the Data
	
•Use of WHERE clause for filtering rows.
   	
•Logical operators such as AND, OR.

•Pattern matching with LIKE.

•Range filtering using BETWEEN.

 

3.	Sorting and Limiting Results
	
•Sorting using ORDER BY clause.
 
•Use of LIMIT to restrict the number of returned rows

# Outcome:

 Learned how to:
 
    •	Extract specific data from one or more tables.
	
	•	Apply different filters for narrowing down the results.
 
	•	Sort and control the amount of displayed data.
